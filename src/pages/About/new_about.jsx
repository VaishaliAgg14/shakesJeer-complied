          We're a highly motivated team of talented undergrads of NSUT who are
          all commited to the cause : proliferate more involvement of students
          in the open mics as we provide a platform for the talent that is
          concealed within the students in abundance! The open mic covers Stand
          Ups, Raps and Poetry with a special limelight on the art of comedy and
          wit.
